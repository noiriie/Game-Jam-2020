## How to use:

### 1) Creating Characters:
_If you don't plan on using character portraits you can skip this step._

You first need to create a `DialogCharacterResource` for each character you wish to have in your dialog.
To do this, right click in your FileSystem and choose `New Resource`, search for `DialogCharacterResource` and create it.
It's good practice to put these inside a `Resources/Characters` folder.
You can assign each character a Name, Image and Color.

There are 3 characters used for the example located at `addons\dialogs\Resources\Characters`.

### 2) Creating dialogs
You can set the dialog code inside the dialog node variable `dialog_script` like in the example and then add the characters that are going to be present in that conversation with the variable `dialog_characters`.

Alternatively you can create a separate dialog resource for each of your dialogs if you wish to keep things logically separate, or you can create a master `DialogResource` if you prefer.
To create a `DialogResource`, right click in your FileSystem and choose `New Resource`, search for `DialogResource` and create it.
Again, it's good practice to put these inside a folder such as `Resources/Dialogs`.
Each `DialogResource` can contain a Dictionary of custom variables that will be replaced by their value when you add them to a script in the form of "This is a [custom] value" where the value for the dictionary key `custom` will replace `[custom]`.
Same as before, you must also provide the `DialogResource` with an array of your `DialogCharacterResource` files.


You can set the dialog script (.json) on the inspector variable "Dialog Json" or by setting the dialog content by changing the variable `dialog_script` of the node.

### 3) Adding the node
Now you can add the node `addons/dialogs/Dialog.tscn` to your scenes, assign the desired variable values or `DialogResource` file and use it on your projects.
